Some basic projects to grasp the basics of react and frontend development.  
Some of the major concepts covered in these projects:
1) the flow of react code. this can be very well understood in the 00customReact project.
2) usage of props in react to pass information to child components.
3) the useState hook, which re-renders the webpage every time the state changes so that change is propagated everywhere. this tackles the "phantom message problem".
4) the useEffect hook, which re-renders the code only when there is a change in its dependencies.
5) other hooks like useCallback and useRef.
6) making your own hooks as done in 04currency project.

Additionally: these projects also cover basics of:
1) react-router
2) context API
3) redux-toolkit (RTK)

Also, covers some of the utilities provided by tailwindcss (like the dark-mode feature).
